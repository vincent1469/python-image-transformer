Completing this project allowed me to have my first experience using Python scripting with code from other languages. 

Some main issues I faced was one key typo in the output file that prevented me from creating images, 
and an issue where Haskell would not accept my array of integers that I had to convert to
strings. For using our own image, I ran into an issue where grayscaling my image online was still giving
me colour results, which would not allow my code to run. However, I discovered a piece of code
in MATLAB that forced a colour image to become gray scale.
